# Using External CSS Libraries 

There are two possible ways (actually more, but that will come later in the course) for including an external CSS library. You can either:

1. Include a link to an external webpage that `hosts` the library. 
2. Download the library, place it in your project's folder, and include the link using relative paths.

Be careful not to include multiple versions of the same library as their behaviours will likely overwrite each other!!!

Look at the examples folder for how to include `Bootstrap` and `Font-Awesome.`
